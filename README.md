# PrismLauncher-without-MS-account
a modified accounts.json file to allow user to play MC without Microsoft account

# Note:
## as for version 10.0.1 launcher will request to server to check the lisence (everytime we start the game? havent check the source code) so modify accounts.json does not work anymore, use older versions instead

# Instruction
* download and install PrimsLauncher like usual
* download and move/replace accounts.json file from this repo to PrimsLauncher folder (might have to replace old file, be aware to backup your account list if you have them before)
* launch the game, you should see FakeAuthMCAccount added to account list, now you can start playing like normal
